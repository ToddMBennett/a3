# CSCI 15 Spring 2017 - A3: Bill Splitter
# Helps users accurately split bills with others, including tipping and rounding

# Referenced a lot of the notes provided from lecture in Github.
# Looked over documentation for Laravel - Routing, Controllers, validation.
# Searched throughout the web for a way to fix the green space before hitting calculate to no avail.
# Watched videos from the lecture to try and pick up how to implement the concepts used and apply into my own  
# app, helped out in some places and other places set me back a bit.
